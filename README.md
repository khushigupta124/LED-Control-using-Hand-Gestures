# LED Control Using Hand Gestures

## **Overview**  
This project introduces a novel way to interact with electronics using **hand gestures** instead of traditional buttons or switches. By leveraging **computer vision** and **machine learning**, users can control LEDs using specific hand movements. A camera captures these gestures, and an AI-based recognition system processes them in real time to trigger LED actions.  

## **Objective**  
The primary objective of this project is to develop a **gesture-based LED control system** that enhances human-computer interaction. This includes:  
- Eliminating the need for physical switches by using **hand gestures**.  
- Implementing **real-time gesture recognition** using computer vision.  
- Integrating **AI-driven processing** to improve recognition accuracy.  
- Showcasing a working prototype that can be extended to other applications like **smart home automation** and **assistive technology**.  

## **Features**  
- **Gesture-Based LED Control** – No need for physical switches.  
- **Real-Time Processing** – Uses a webcam to detect hand gestures instantly.  
- **AI-Powered Recognition** – Uses OpenCV & MediaPipe for accurate tracking.  
- **Arduino Integration** – Controls LEDs based on recognized gestures.  
- **User-Friendly & Interactive** – Enhancing human-computer interaction.  

## **Technologies Used**  

### **Hardware Components**  
- **Webcam** (or any compatible camera) – Captures hand movements.  
- **Arduino Board** – Microcontroller for LED control.
